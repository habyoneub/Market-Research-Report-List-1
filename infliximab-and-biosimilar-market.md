<p><h1>Infliximab and Biosimilar Market Provides a Comprehensive Analysis Including a Macro Overview of the Market, Micro Details such as Market Size and Competitive Landscape</h1></p><p><strong>Infliximab and Biosimilar Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), used primarily in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis. As the patent for infliximab expired, biosimilars—biologically similar products manufactured to be highly similar to the reference product—have emerged, offering cost-effective alternatives. These biosimilars provide the same therapeutic benefits and safety profiles as infliximab, promoting increased access for patients.</p><p>The Infliximab and Biosimilar Market is experiencing significant growth, driven by rising prevalence of autoimmune disorders, increased healthcare expenditure, and a growing emphasis on affordable treatment options. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.9% during the forecast period. Additionally, the acceptance of biosimilars in treatment protocols and growing physician awareness further contribute to market expansion. Recent trends indicate a shift towards personalized medicine and the introduction of more advanced biosimilars, enhancing treatment efficacy. Furthermore, regulatory bodies' efforts to streamline biosimilar approval processes are expected to encourage the development of these products, further fueling market growth and competition.</p></p>
