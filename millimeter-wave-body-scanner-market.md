<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Millimeter Wave Body Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Scanning</li><li>Cylindrical Scanning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Millimeter wave body scanners are categorized into two main types: flat scanning and cylindrical scanning. Flat scanning employs a stationary platform where individuals stand still while the scanner captures images from multiple angles, ideal for efficient screening in airports and public places. In contrast, cylindrical scanning utilizes a rotating device that encircles the person, providing a 360-degree view for enhanced detection capabilities. Both technologies enhance security by identifying concealed items while maintaining user privacy and comfort during the scanning process.</p></p>
