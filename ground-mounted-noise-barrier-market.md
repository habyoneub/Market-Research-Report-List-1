<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Type Noise Barrier</li><li>ABSorptive Type Noise Barrier</li><li>Mixed Type Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ground-mounted noise barrier market comprises three main types: reflective, absorptive, and mixed noise barriers. Reflective type barriers are designed to deflect sound waves away from sensitive areas, making them effective in high-noise environments. Absorptive type barriers, on the other hand, are constructed to soak up sound energy, reducing overall noise levels. Mixed type barriers combine both reflective and absorptive properties to enhance sound attenuation, offering versatility in various applications, such as highways, railways, and urban developments.</p></p>
